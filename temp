## **Service Principal Secret Retrieval via EVA Integration**

### **Overview**

This document outlines the process by which Azure-integrated systems retrieve secrets associated with service principals using **EVA (Enterprise Vault Automation)** and **Vault Metadata Runtime**. The operation is centered around a **Software Component Identifier (SWCI)**.

---

### **Process Flow**

1. **EVA Integration from Azure**
   The process begins with a completed EVA integration from the Azure environment. This integration ensures secure connectivity and authentication to the enterprise vault infrastructure.

2. **Invoke Vault Metadata Runtime**
   Once EVA is integrated, the system invokes the **Vault Metadata Runtime** service to query service principal associations. This runtime call is made at execution time to ensure up-to-date metadata.

3. **Identify Service Principals for SWCI**
   Using the provided **Software Component Identifier (SWCI)**, the Vault Metadata Runtime returns a list of all service principals linked to the specified component. These service principals represent identities used by the component to access Azure resources.

4. **Iterate and Retrieve Secrets**
   For each service principal retrieved:

   * Query the vault for the associated secret (such as a client secret or certificate).
   * Ensure secure handling and usage of the secret in the runtime environment.

---

### **Security Considerations**

* All communication with EVA and Vault is secured via mutual TLS (mTLS) and/or Azure-managed identity authentication.
* Secrets are never stored in logs or local files and are used strictly in-memory during runtime.
* Access control policies must ensure only authorized applications can invoke the metadata runtime and retrieve secrets.
